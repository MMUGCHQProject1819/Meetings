#Plan Of Action
======
##Worth noting that if you haven't made an E-mail and a github account in the Professional Development Lab you should make one now!

1. Get to know each other

2. Talk about the Project, and our skills

3. Talk about next meeting and when we make contact with Katie (katie46354@gchq.gov.uk) exchange E-mails/Github accounts

..+ Add everyone to the Github Organisation
..+ Decide whether we will use Github for collaborating in the Project and Google Drive for the documents or only Github

4. Some more talk about us in general
..+ complaints
..+ feedback on the format of the meeting
