Plan Of Action:

Technical Questions 

1. What kind of application are we going to develop? e.g. Web app, Desktop app etc. 
2. What operating system are we going to use?
3. What programming language and library are we going to use? Likely to be the OpenCV library which supports Python, Java and C++.
4. How much flexibility will the library give us? 
5. Can we write some of our own code for facial recognition?

Rough plans:
Build the facial recognition program with OpenCV and Python.

What needs to be done:
1. Meeting on the 5th with the client (Need to book/find a room)
2. Prepare for the presentation (Answer the questions on the powerpoint)
3. More research into facial recognition, OpenCV, machine learning and the appropriate algorithms.
